## Hello
ğŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m @NaomiLocket, but you can use Na Na.

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in technology in general and in a basic form. I'm also interested in developments in interactive entertainment, and changes in game engine technology.
However I play games too much.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m occasionally learning `LSL`, `C#`, `Python`, and `Lua`.
